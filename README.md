# Data Cleaning, Outlier Detection, and Visualization of Car Prices Dataset

In this project, we will conduct data preprocessing, outlier detection, and exploratory visualization on a dataset containing car prices. The dataset includes key attributes such as Selling Price, Market Price, Model, Odometer, Condition, and other relevant features for various car brands. Our objective is to ensure data quality by systematically handling missing values, identifying outliers in critical numerical fields like pricing and odometer readings, and visualizing data patterns to extract valuable insights into the factors that influence car prices.

The process will involve:

Data Cleaning: Addressing missing values and ensuring data integrity. Outlier Detection: Detecting and mitigating anomalies in the dataset, especially in pricing and odometer fields. Visualization: Creating insightful visualizations to explore trends, correlations, and distributions, enabling a better understanding of how variables such as condition, mileage, and market prices impact the selling price. By the end of this analysis, we will have a clean dataset ready for further analysis or modeling, along with visual insights that highlight the relationships between various factors influencing car prices.
